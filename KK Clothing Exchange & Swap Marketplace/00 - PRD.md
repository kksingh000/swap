## Context
Fast fashion has significantly increased clothing consumption, leading to textile waste and environmental issues. Many people have wearable clothes in good condition that they no longer use but find it inconvenient to sell or donate. Traditional e-commerce platforms focus mainly on buying and selling clothes. However, there is growing interest in sustainable fashion practices, including clothing reuse and exchange. The Clothing Exchange & Swap Marketplace is designed to enable users to directly swap clothes with other users instead of purchasing new ones. Users can list clothes they want to exchange, browse available items, and send swap requests to other users. The platform also supports value-based swap suggestions and location-based matching to make exchanges easier. This system promotes a barter economy model, encouraging sustainable fashion and reducing clothing waste.
